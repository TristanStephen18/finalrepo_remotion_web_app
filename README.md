open your terminal in the root of the project then run "npm i" and wait for it to finish
after that run "cd server" then run "npm i" again then wait for it to finish
after that run "cd.." to go back then "cd frontend" then run "npm i" and wait for it to finish
then for the last folder run "cd.." then "cd server", "cd remotion_templates", and "cd TemplateHolder" then run the last "npm i" 

after that you can open a new terminal then run "npm start", click the link "http://localhost:3000" or paste it in your browser
Access the "http://localhost:3000/login" route to login to the web application

P.S This application won't run without an env file at the root folder

For port tunneling/sharing:
run "npm cloudflared --version"to see if cloudflared is installed, if not "npm i cloudflared" to install it
then after successful installation run "cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:3000" while the poject is running 
then you wlll get the -
